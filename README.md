> **Options+ ? Try OpenLogi.**

Remap buttons, drive DPI and SmartShift, and switch profiles per app — without a Logitech account, telemetry, or the official Options+ install. No cloud, plain TOML config; the only network calls are device-image fetches and an opt-in, off-by-default update check.

---

## What it is

OpenLogi talks to Logitech HID++ mice over a Logi Bolt receiver — or a
Bluetooth-direct / wired connection — without running Logi Options+. It ships
two binaries:

- **[OpenLogi GUI](crates/openlogi-gui)** — a GPUI desktop app: an interactive mouse diagram with clickable hotspots, a per-button action picker (41 built-in actions plus custom keyboard shortcuts authored in the TOML config), DPI presets, a SmartShift panel (wheel mode, sensitivity, permanent ratchet), per-application profile overlays, a device carousel that switches between paired devices live, and a Settings window with a UI localized into 20 languages.
- **[OpenLogi CLI](crates/openlogi-cli)** — a CLI for headless inventory (`list`) plus asset-sync and on-device diagnostic subcommands.

Everything is local: bindings live in a plain TOML file, button presses are remapped through the OS event tap, and DPI / SmartShift changes are written straight to the device over HID++.

macOS and Linux are supported. Windows is an early, untested preview — signed
builds ship with each release; see [Roadmap](#roadmap).

## Beyond Options+

Things OpenLogi does that Options+ won't:

- **Run on Linux.** Options+ ships for macOS and Windows only. OpenLogi treats
  Linux as a first-class platform: evdev/uinput hook, udev rules, a systemd
  user unit, and `.deb` / `.rpm` packages.
- **Move the Gesture Button.** Pick which physical button owns the gesture
  role — thumb pad, middle, back, or forward — with per-direction swipe
  bindings, or turn gestures off entirely. Options+ pins the gesture role to
  the dedicated thumb pad.
- **Keep config in plain text.** Everything is one TOML file you can read,
  diff, version-control, and copy between machines.
- **Script it.** A real CLI: device inventory, asset prefetch, and on-device
  HID++ diagnostics (feature dump, DPI / SmartShift round-trips).
- **Stay light.** Native Rust + GPUI binaries — no Electron suite, no resident
  updaters, no account, no telemetry.

## Roadmap

| Capability | State |
|---|---|
| Discover Bolt receivers + list paired devices (CLI + GUI) | ✅ |
| Unifying receivers (older protocol, replaced by Bolt) | ✅ |
| Bluetooth-direct / wired devices (no receiver) | ✅ |
| Battery percentage / charge state | ✅ (online devices) |
| Interactive GUI: carousel, mouse diagram, action picker | ✅ macOS + Linux |
| Button remapping via the OS event tap / evdev hook | ✅ macOS + Linux |
| 41-action catalog + custom keyboard shortcuts (TOML-authored) | ✅ macOS + Linux¹ |
| DPI control + presets + Cycle / Set-preset actions (HID++ `0x2201`) | ✅ |
| SmartShift wheel: mode toggle + sensitivity + permanent-ratchet panel (HID++ `0x2111`) | ✅ |
| Per-application profile overlays (auto-switch on app focus) | ✅ macOS, 🟡 Linux (X11 only) |
| Settings window: launch-at-login, update check, menu-bar, permissions, language | ✅ macOS + Linux |
| Interface localization (20 languages: da, de, el, en, es, fi, fr, it, ja, ko, nb, nl, pl, pt-BR, pt-PT, ru, sv, zh-CN, zh-HK, zh-TW) | ✅ |
| Linux packaging: udev rules, systemd unit, `.deb` / `.rpm` | ✅ Linux |
| Gesture-button per-direction bindings | 🟡 configurable; hardware capture pending |
| Middle / mode-shift / thumbwheel button capture | 🟡 configurable; hook owns side buttons only |
| Windows (agent, GUI, event hook) | 🟡 untested preview — signed `.exe` / `.msi` ship per release |

¹ Media key actions use D-Bus MPRIS on Linux; a handful of macOS-specific actions (e.g. Launchpad) have no Linux equivalent and are no-ops.

## Install

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Quit **Logi Options+** first — the two applications fight over HID++ access and only one can own a given receiver at a time.

### macOS

Download the signed, notarized `.dmg` from the [latest release](https://github.com/AprilNEA/OpenLogi/releases/latest) and drag `OpenLogi.app` to `/Applications`.

Or install via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

```sh
brew install --cask openlogi
```

The official Homebrew cask is the default installation path. To explicitly
track the latest GitHub release from `aprilnea/tap` instead:

```sh
brew tap aprilnea/tap
brew install --cask aprilnea/tap/openlogi@latest
```

`openlogi@latest` is maintained by OpenLogi's release workflow and may update
before the official cask autobump lands. Install either `openlogi` or
`openlogi@latest`, not both.

### Linux

Download the `.deb` or `.rpm` from the [latest release](https://github.com/AprilNEA/OpenLogi/releases/latest):

```sh
# Debian / Ubuntu
sudo dpkg -i openlogi_*.deb

# Fedora / RHEL
sudo rpm -i openlogi-*.rpm
```

Packages are published for both `x86_64`/`amd64` and `arm64`/`aarch64`.

The package installs udev rules that grant your user access to
`/dev/hidraw*` and `/dev/uinput` without `sudo`. After installation,
enable the background agent for your user:

```sh
systemctl --user enable --now openlogi-agent.service
```

See [docs/INSTALL-linux.md](docs/INSTALL-linux.md) for manual / source installs
and distros without systemd.

### Windows (preview)

Signed `.exe` and per-user `.msi` installers (x86_64 and arm64) are attached to
each release. Windows support is an early preview that hasn't been broadly
tested on real hardware yet — expect rough edges, and please
[report issues](https://github.com/AprilNEA/OpenLogi/issues).

To build from source, see [DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md).
