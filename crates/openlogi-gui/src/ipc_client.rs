//! Client side of the agent IPC.
//!
//! The agent owns all device I/O, so the GUI never opens a device — it connects
//! to the agent's Unix socket and (a) polls status + inventory on a timer to
//! drive the device list and the Accessibility gate, and (b) forwards "apply
//! now" / "read" device commands. Both run on one dedicated OS thread with a
//! tokio runtime (the GPUI thread owns no async runtime), mirroring the old
//! watcher pattern: results cross back over `mpsc` to the GPUI loop.
//!
//! The single client connection is re-established by this loop itself: polling
//! runs at [`STARTUP_POLL_PERIOD`] until the agent's first completed
//! enumeration and again after any disconnect (an agent self-exec on update, a
//! crash), and [`spawn_agent`] relaunches the binary when the socket stays
//! down — there is no launchd dependency here (`KeepAlive` only acts when the
//! agent *exits*, and autostart may be off entirely). When the agent stays
//! unreachable or answers with a newer protocol, that is pushed to the GUI as
//! a [`GuiUpdate`] so the window can say so instead of spinning forever.
