//! Background HID++ control-capture watcher for the active device.
//!
//! Runs [`openlogi_hid::run_capture_session`] on a dedicated thread for whichever
//! device the DPI / SmartShift path currently targets
//! ([`DpiCycleState::target`]), restarts it when the carousel selection — or the
//! thumb-wheel binding — changes, and dispatches each captured input:
//!
//! - a gesture swipe through the gesture binding map,
//! - a DPI/ModeShift or thumb-wheel-tap press through the button binding map,
//! - thumb-wheel rotation re-synthesised as horizontal scroll,
//!
//! all via the common action path ([`crate::hook_runtime::dispatch_action`]).
//!
//! Unlike the CGEventTap hook, this needs no macOS Accessibility permission —
//! the events arrive over HID++, and the bound action is synthesised the same
//! way regardless.
