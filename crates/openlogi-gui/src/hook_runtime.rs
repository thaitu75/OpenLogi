//! Runtime bridge between background input events and OpenLogi actions.
//!
//! The GPUI thread owns `AppState`, while the CGEventTap hook and HID++
//! gesture watcher run outside it. This module contains the shared runtime
//! surface between them: the binding map mirrored from `AppState`, lazy hook
//! installation, and action dispatch for both hook and gesture events.
