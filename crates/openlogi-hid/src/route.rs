//! How to reach a controllable HID++ device, and the logic to (re-)open its
//! channel.
//!
//! Two addressing modes:
//!
//! - [`DeviceRoute::Bolt`] — a device paired to a Logi Bolt receiver, reached
//!   through the receiver channel at a pairing slot.
//! - [`DeviceRoute::Direct`] — a device attached straight to the host over a
//!   USB cable or Bluetooth, reached on its own channel at the HID++
//!   self-index [`DIRECT_DEVICE_INDEX`].
//!
//! Both the write path ([`crate::write`]) and the capture session
//! ([`crate::gesture`]) resolve a route to an open channel through
//! [`open_route_channel`], so the Bolt-vs-direct branch lives in exactly one
//! place.
