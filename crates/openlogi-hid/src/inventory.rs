/// > asset registry > **HID++ `0x0005`** > **Bolt pairing register**
///
/// This folds the two HID++ sources; the GUI applies the final asset-registry
/// override in `effective_kind` (`crates/openlogi-gui/src/state/devices.rs`).
/// Adding a kind source means slotting it into this one chain — and updating
/// both docs.
///
/// `0x0005` is the device's self-reported marketing type and is authoritative;
/// the Bolt pairing register is a coarser hint that can misreport (e.g. an
/// MX Anywhere 3S surfacing as `Keyboard`, which strips its button/pointer tabs
/// — issue #127). We therefore trust `probed` whenever it names a kind we model,
/// falling back to `register` when the device was offline (no probe → `None`),
/// didn't answer `0x0005`, or reported a type we don't map (`Unknown`). On the
/// receiver-less direct path `register` is simply `Unknown`.
