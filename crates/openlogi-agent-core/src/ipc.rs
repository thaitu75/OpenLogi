//! tarpc service contract between the GUI (client) and the agent (server).
//!
//! tarpc generates the `AgentClient` and the `serve` glue from this trait. tarpc
//! is strict request/response — no server push — so the streaming needs become
//! polling: the GUI polls [`Agent::inventory`]/[`Agent::status`] on a timer, and
//! the Add Device flow long-polls [`Agent::next_pairing`], which the agent holds
//! open until a pairing event arrives or the request deadline elapses.
