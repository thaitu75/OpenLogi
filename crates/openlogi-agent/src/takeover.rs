//! Replace a running agent that speaks an older IPC protocol.
//!
//! The self-restart watcher (see [`crate::self_restart`]) keeps a *future*
//! stale agent from outliving an update — but the watcher only exists in
//! binaries that ship it, so the first protocol bump still strands every
//! user whose pre-watcher agent is running: it never exits, launchd only
//! acts on exit, it holds the singleton lock so every freshly-spawned new
//! agent loses and quits, and the new GUI refuses the old protocol — parking
//! the user on the connecting screen until the next login.
//!
//! The escape hatch runs in the *new* agent: when it loses the singleton
//! lock, it connects to the IPC socket as a client and asks the lock holder
//! for its protocol version. If the holder is provably older, the holder is
//! a leftover from before the update — terminate it and take the lock. The
//! `protocol_version` handshake is wire-stable across versions (method 0,
//! plain `u32`), so this works against any past agent. A holder that is the
//! same version or newer means *we* are the duplicate (or the stale one),
//! and we exit as before.
//!
//! SIGTERM, not a polite RPC: past protocols have no quit method. If the old
//! agent ran under launchd, dying by signal is a non-successful exit, so
//! launchd respawns it — from the bundle path, i.e. as the *new* binary —
//! and whichever copy loses the ensuing lock race exits cleanly. Either way
//! exactly one up-to-date agent survives.
