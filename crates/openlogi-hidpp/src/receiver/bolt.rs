//! Implements the Logi Bolt receiver.
//!
//! Bolt can be seen as a successor to the Unifying receiver. Both of them
//! support up to 6 paired devices, but Bolt uses BTLE technology and introduces
//! so-called passkeys for authenticating devices before pairing them.
//!
//! There is little to no public documentation about what registers Bolt
//! supports (and they seem to differ quite substantially from registers
//! supported by Unifying and other receivers), so this implementation is based
//! largely on information gathered by looking at other codebases (primarily
//! Solaar) and searching registers by fuzzing them.
